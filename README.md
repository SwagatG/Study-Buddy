<h2>The Story Behind Study Buddy</h2>
My grade 12 Biology teacher was known to be very tough, but also, thoroughly rewarding. For a cumulative test, we were to be given 50 definitions to which we had to match 50 terms. A few weeks before this test, we were instructed to create an exhaustive list of all the terms we had encountered. If the list was deemed comprehensive, the definitions on the test would only be those that defined a term on the list. Thus the class was incentivized to put together a passable list, and create their own definitions to study.

This is where I got the idea for Study Buddy. I realized that reading through a 1000 words and definitions on a Google Doc was not the best way for me to memorize these terms. I yearned for a more efficient system to learn, and I laid out certain desires:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>I wanted something that would randomly generate definitions from the list or a particular unit that we covered, so that I could match them to terms. </li>
<li>I wanted to be able to save the words I found particularly tricky to better review at a later time.</li>
<li>I wanted to be able to type in the terms myself to ensure that I was using proper spelling. </li>
<li>I wanted to see definitions I was struggling with more frequently, and those I found easy much less so.</li>
<li>And finally, I  wanted to be able to save my data, so that I could close the program and still have it remember my needs.</li>   
</ul>
With this in mind, I went on to create Study Buddy, and meet my every desire.

<h2> Features:</h2>
<ol type = “A”>
 <li><h4>Custom Input</h4></li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
   <li>Provides an intuitive way for users to format text into units, terms and definitions.</li>
   <li>Allows users to expand the list over time.</li>
  </ul>
 <li><h4>Random Term Generation</h4></li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
   <li>Designed for initial review. Exposes users to all terms in the list, or all terms in a chosen unit.</li>
   <li>Allows users to save particularly difficult terms for later revision.</li>
  </ul>
 <li><h4>Saving and Reviewing Tricky Terms</h4></li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
   <li>Upon saving tricky terms, a user may choose to only review those terms, thus optimizing time by avoiding easier terms.</li>
   <li>The words may be removed from the saved list at any time.</li>
  </ul>
 <li><h4>Mastery Mode</h4></li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
   <li>Allows the user to type in the term that matches a randomly generated definition. The program will then check spelling.</li>
   <li>Upon correctly spelling a term 3 times, the term will be 'mastered' and appear much less frequently.</li>
  </ul>
 <li><h4>Editing and Deleting Terms</h4></li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
   <li>Users are provided with a system to browse through terms, and are given the option to change them.</li>
   <li>Provides an in program method to edit typos, or remove ridiculously easy terms.</li>
  </ul>
 <li><h4>Outputting a Formatted List</h4></li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
   <li>Allows to user to output a formatted list of terms and definitions.</li>
   <li>Makes terms easy to alphabetize and share with others.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
