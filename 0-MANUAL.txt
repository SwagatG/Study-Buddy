This is a manual for STUDY BUDDY, created by Swagat Ghimire.

I recommend that every user read section 1, as understanding it is crucial to using the app.

Section 2 is an optional read, and much of what is covers can be discovered by playing around with
the application.

SECTION 1: INPUTTING DATA

This application must be able to understand the information you have prepared, and as such, you
must perfectly follow these instructions in order for it to properly function.

	PART A) THE INPUT FILES
	The program has been instructed to read information from the file "1-InputWords.txt".
	Because of this, you must copy all of your data onto the said file. It is advised that you
	compile list on a separate file (Google Doc or Microsoft Word type documents), as they are
	much easier to work with than txt files. You can then quickly copy paste your data. See
	section 1B for information on formatting.

	Adittionaly, it is crucial that the program "StudyBuddy.exe" is in the same folder as
	the "1-InputWords.txt" file.
	
	After using the program, you may notice that a "2-StudyData.dat" file has been created in
	the same folder as the program. Please avoid tampering with, moving, or deleting this file,
	as it stores all of your save data, and mastery data (see sections 2B and 2C to know about
	those features).

	PART B) INPUT FORMAT
	The program allows you to separate your words by unit. So you will have to provide it with
	not only terms and definitions, but also unit markers (to mark the start of a new unit),
	and the unit names.

	The start of every unit (including the first one) should have the word "UNIT" (in all caps,
	exactly as shown). Then on the next line (no spaces after the word UNIT please), the name
	of that unit should be placed. On the next line you may place a term (you may have
	empty units if you so fancy), and on the following line, must have the definition. The
	definitions may be as long as necessary (if it appears to be on two lines, that's okay,
	just don't press 'enter' in the middle of it). After this you may place more word-definition
	pairs, or start a new unit as explained earlier.

	PART C) EDITTING, ADDING, AND DELETING WORDS
	You may edit words and definitions (to fix typos) directly on the "1-InputWords.txt" file
	(you can also do this through the app as explained in section 2D). However, if you wish to 
	add or delete words, you must be very careful and follow these instructions. This is because
	the saved data on your study terms and mastery information may be ruined if you do not do
	as instructed.

	DELETING WORDS:
	1) Open the "StudyBuddy.exe" application.
	2) From the main menu, choose option 4 (See and Edit Words)
	3) In the following menu, select the unit of the word you wish to delete.
	4) In the following menu, select the word you wish to delete.
	5) In the following menu, Press "D" to delete the word.
	6) Confirm you want to delete the word by pressing "Y".
	7) NOTE: If you messed up, you may close the app at this point, and it won't save the delete
	8) After pressing any key to continue, your delete will be saved.

	ADDING WORDS:
	1) Open the "1-InputWords.txt" file (or the word document containing the same information).
	2) Find the location of the unit in which you wish to add a word.
	3) AFTER the LAST word in that unit, add your word on a new line, and the definition on the
	   following line.
	4) you may do this as much as you wish.
	NOTE: New units may also be added; new units must be added after the last unit in the
	"1-InputWords.txt" file. 

	PART D) SAMPLE INPUT
	Try copy pasting the below information onto the "1-InputWords.txt" file (Start copying the
	line after the asterisk '*' and end the line before the second asterisk). Save the file and
	open the "StudyBuddy.exe" application to see how it works. You can play around with 
	it, but if you stray from the proper formatting, you may cause the program to crash or not 
	work properly.

SECTION 2: FUNCTIONS OF THE PROGRAM
Upon opening the ""StudyBuddy.exe" file, you may do any of the following. Note that much of
the below information is very intuitive for people who have been using computers and english for a
while.

	PART A) RANDOM WORD GENERATION
	1) After opening the app, press any key to see the main menu.
	2) Select option 1 (Randomly Practice Words)
	3) In the next menu, Select the unit you wish to practice (or 0 to practice everything)
	4) Definitions from the chosen unit will randomly be generated. Press any key to see the
	   related word.
	5) From here, you may save words to review (see section 2B), generate another word, or
	   return to the main menu.

	B) Saving Words to Review
	You may save particularly tricky words to review separately. It is possible to do this
	from the random word generation mode, mastery mode browsing and editting
	mode. These words can also be removed from the saved list from any of the above modes,
	as well as in the practice saved words mode.
	
	You may choose to practice saved words from certain units, or all units, as with the
	random word generation mode.

	If you wish to clear all saved terms, you may delete the "2-StudyData.dat" file. 
	NOTE: This will also delete all mastery data.

	C) Mastery Mode
	In mastery mode, you will be able to type in the answers to the definition. The marker
	ignores the case of the letters you enter, but spelling is important. If you correctly
	type in the word that corresponds to the definition, your mastery streak will increase.
	When your streak is 3, the word will be mastered and will then be seen less frequently.
	Errors reset the streak to 0.
	
	As with the above sections, you may choose to do this for a certain unit, or the entire
	word list.

	If you wish to clear all mastery data, you may delete the "2-StudyData.dat" file. 
	NOTE: This will also delete all saved terms.

	D) Editting And Deleting Words
	As explained in section 1C, you may edit and delete words in the program.
	
	E) Outputting A Formatted Word List (Easy to Alphabetize)
	If you wish to do so, you may output all of your words onto a text file in the following
	format:
	Word1: Definition 1
	Word2: Definition 2
	and so on. These words are not alphabetized, but that can be done by copying the
	data onto a Microsoft Word Document, a Google Doc, or other similar program.

Good Luck, and I hope this program helps.
